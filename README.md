# pytest-loco

Declarative DSL for structured, extensible test scenarios in pytest.

`pytest-loco` introduces a YAML-based domain-specific language (DSL) for
describing test workflows in a declarative and composable way.
It is designed to support structured validation, data-driven execution,
and pluggable extensions such as HTTP, JSON, and custom domain logic.
